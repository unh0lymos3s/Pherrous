# Pherrous
A distributed, volunteer computing system written in Rust. 
This is mainly a learning project, trying to implement everything from scratch; not using coding agents for this one lol.
Hopefully I'll have a better understanding of Networking, Concurrency and Rust by the time It starts looking decent.

Thank you [BOINC](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc) for the inspo!
